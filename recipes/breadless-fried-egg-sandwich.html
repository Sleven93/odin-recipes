                Crack eggs side by side into the skillet; season with salt and black pepper. 
                Cook until egg whites are set and firm, 3 to 4 minutes. 
                Flip eggs. 
                Sprinkle bacon pieces and Cheddar cheese over one egg. 
                Continue cooking to desired doneness and cheese is melted, 3 to 4 minutes more.
